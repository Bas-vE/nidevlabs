This branch serves as a starting point for a concepts and tutorials page that covers basic usage and extension of the NI Diagram SDK, which ships with LabVIEW NXG. 

To be clear, this is a work in progress that is based on outdated documentation and likely has a great deal of information that could be incomplete, misleading or even blatantly wrong. Do no rely on the information contained within.

Once it is fully valid and up-to-date, it will be pulled in to an official NI repo. Until that point, once again, __DO NOT__ assume that anything contained within is correct.

At this point in time, the official [NI nidevlabs repo][https://github.com/ni/nidevlabs] should be considered the only "correct" source of information.
